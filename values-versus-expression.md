### values are expressions but expressions are not values

```js
"JavaScript" + " " + "is" + " " + "great."
  //=> "JavaScript is great."
```


**strings** are values, and you can make an expression out of strings and an operator **+**. Since strings are values, they are also expressions by themselves. But strings with operators are not values, they are expressions.
